    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of 
        the page. And if the page is a long one it might 
        be split up into several                    <b>sub-headings</b>.<p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>

    <p>Many long articles have <i>sub-headings</i> so to help 
        you follow the structure of what is being written. 
        There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level 
        headings).</p>
